# EC601Hw2 Part1

# Trello: https://trello.com/b/WVPPJihH/ec601-hw2
This is part1 for homework2.<br />
I made my own resume website, containing my basic information, a video of one project I made last semester and my CV.  <br />
To open the website, just download the whole folder and open Tianyi's CV1.html.  <br />
I already add the friendly chat app, which is the part 2 of the homework to this webpage. <br />
# Unit Test
For Unit Test, please see the second part of homework. Link: https://github.com/Tianyi94/EC601Hw2Part2
